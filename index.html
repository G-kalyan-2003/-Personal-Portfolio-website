        <h4>1.MINI PROJECT</h4>
        <h4>Sales Prediction Model for Big Mart</h4>
        <p>Big Mart is a big supermarket chain, with stores all
            around the country and its current board set out a
            challenge to all Data Scientist out there to help
            them create a model that can predict the sales, per
            product, for each store to give accurate results.
            Big Mart has collected sales data from Kaggle, for
            various products across different stores in different
            cities. With this information the corporation hopes
            we can identify the products and stores which play
            a key role in their sales and use that information to
            take the correct measures to ensure success of their
            business.
            Algorithms used: Linear Regression
            Random Forest
            Decision Tree
            XGBoost</p>
        <h4>2.COMMUNITY SERVICE PROJECT</h4>
        <h4>Blood Group and Blood Picture</h4>
        <p>The "Blood Group and Blood Picture Project" is an 
            educational initiative aimed at exploring the fundamental 
            aspects of human blood, focusing on blood groups and the 
            microscopic examination of blood samples.</p>
        <h4>3.CRIME DATA ANALYSISI USING MACHINE LEARNING MODELS</h4>
        <p>The criminal cases in India are increasing rapidly due to which 
        number of cases pending are also piling up. This continuous increase 
        in the criminal cases is proving to be difficult to be classified and to be solved. 
        Recognizing the criminal activity patterns of a place is important in order to prevent it from happening. 
        The crime solving agencies can do a better work if they have a good idea of the pattern of criminal activities 
        that are happening in a particular area. This can be done by using machine learning by employing different algorithms 
        to find the patterns of the criminal activities in a particular area. This paper uses crime data set and predicts the 
        types of crimes in a particular area which helps in speeding up the classification of criminal cases and proceed accordingly. 
        This paper uses the data of past 18 years that is collected from various trusted sources. Data pre-processing is as important as 
        final prediction, this paper used feature selection, removing null values and label encoding to clean and nourish the data. This research 
        gives an efficient machine leaning model for predicting the next criminal case.</p>
